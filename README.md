# EthereumBlockExplorer

This Ethereum Block Explorer was completed as a weekend project as part of my ChainShot Ethereum Bootcamp curriculumn.  It has a live block counter, live gas estimate, and can query any address for an Ether balance on the mainnet.  It can also tell the address holding an NFT given the contract that the NFT originates from and the tokenID.  In the future I may expand this functionality to show the price that the NFT last sold for.
